=== ADDSynth

ADDSynth is ZynAddSubFX's additive synthesizer.

This is the most common synth of choice, and you should use it any time you need
more than one voice, modulation, or a simple, one-oscillator patch.

It features 8 voices,
each of which can be toggled using the power button in the top-left corner of the ADDSynth panel
or using the voice grid below the ADDSynth panel button.

This section is meant to be a detailed explanation of various parts of ADDSynth.
If you haven't tried to use ADDSynth practically, please consult the tutorials.
