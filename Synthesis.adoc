This section is meant to document how ZynAddSubFX generates sound,
and how you can use that to make any sound that comes to mind!

=== Synthesis Modules

Firstly, before getting into the synthesis engines,
we should note that certain synthesis modules appear pretty often,
so it would be very good if we covered those first.

Don't worry, we'll get into the good stuff soon, this section only
serves so we don't have to explain terms like LFO, ADSR, punch, stretch, velocity sensing and so on
every time they appear.
And, as you'll see, no matter how scary Zyn-Fusion might look, the same elements work the same
in every situation, so it's not as daunting as you might think!
