This section aims to introduce the user to Zyn's UI elements and explain their behaviour in detail.

// TODO: Virtual keyboard panel

=== Panels

When you run Zyn-Fusion you'll be presented with this window:

// TODO: Color the elements here and use the colors as help.
image::imgs/bank-read.png[]

// TODO: Each panel a color
As you can see it is divided into multiple panels, each with their own use.
When navigating between different _views_, you'll consistently see the status
panel on top of the window, the navigation panel on the left, and the bottom the
virtual keyboard.
In the middle of all of those is the content view which you can expect to change
when navigating around Zyn-Fusion

==== Status Panel

The status panel is where you'll find a few global parameters, the file menu,
automation-learn/fine-tuning mode selectors, the panic button, master VU meter,
and the information tray. It is always situated at the top of Zyn's UI.
We will be reading the status panel right-to-left, since you'll most often be using
the righthand side.

Panic button::
    When getting started you'll want to be familiar with the panic button as
    it will instantly silence the audio produced by Zyn, no matter what state
    the synth is in. It's a safety device in case the sounds go out of control.

Master VU meter::
    This meter will display the current audio output levels. It can be useful for a few things:
    * It'll let you decide on choosing an optimal sound level for your patch.
    * It might be helpful to find out which instance of Zyn-Fusion is currently making sounds, if you're working with a few of them at once.
    * It'll help you make sure your MIDI keyboard is connected properly.

Volume slider::
    This slider is used to change the global volume of ZynAddSubFX.

// TODO: When this changes, use: Allows shifting the input note up/down by a specified amount.
Key shift slider::
    Allows shifting the relation between which note would be played originally and which is played now.
    64 means no keyshifting.
    Setting the key shift below 64 shifts the keys down by the absolute difference between 64 and the key shift value.
    Setting it above 64 does the same, except that it shifts the keys up.
    For example, 63 shift all the keys down by 1, and 65 shifts them up by 1.

Fine indicator::
    This indicator shows when parameters are being finely adjusted. Fine adjust
    is trigged by holding *SHIFT* and it can be toggled by clicking on the
    indicator.

// TODO: More info about this in the manual?
BPM panel::
    This panel allows setting the BPM used by the project. This BPM is used
    by LFOs whose frequency is defined with a numerator and denominator.

Information Tray::
    The information tray will show tooltips about Zyn's parameters, current
    parameter values, as well as other status information. Image below.

// TODO: NRPN is not a thing anymore, we now what the BPM textbox
image:imgs/info-tray.png[]

// TODO: More info here
MIDI Learn indicator::
    This indicator shows when MIDI contoller learning is in progress.

// TODO: More info here
Learn indicator::
    This indicator shows when automation learning is in progress.

"FILE" button::
    This button is used to handle all file operations, such as saving, loading and clearing instruments,
    MIDI bindings, microtonal settings, etc.

// TODO: More info here
Stop/Pause/Play buttons::
    Used for the WAV recording feature.

// TODO: Mixed indentation, link to the config window UI
Zyn-Fusion logo box::
    Clicking on the Zyn-Fusion logo toggles two different windows,
    one of them is a wall of text dedicated to all the maintainer of Zyn-Fusion and modern ZynAddSubFX,
    while the other one, more important to you as the user, is the configuration window.

////
.Under Construction
NOTE: At a later point is may be worth describing: NRPN - currently
      non-functional, audio capture (may be worth removing at some point), etc,
      but there are higher priority things to document at the moment
////

////
unfa:
NOTE: Then we'll split up each into parts and describe what each part does in detail, covering every button and field.
      When a button opens a dialog of another window.
      For example clicking on the logo opens up settings - we can branch out and cover that in a different section
      if it's appropriate.
      For example a chapter about Zyn preferences and simply say "here are user preferences - more on that in chapter X"

fundamental:
Contrary to this I'd say do *not* detail everything. Detail what's important and
what can be integrated with the section's flow easily.
The overall guide should help users and not serve as a full specification

unfa: ok, but then -  is there a place for the full specification? I think it's also needed. Do you mean a destinction between a User Manual and a Reference Manual?
////


////
Commented out since this appears to be discussed later
==== Virtual Keyboard

* Virtual keyboard (also usable with QWERTY keyboard - that's important!)
* Virtual keyboard knobs
* MIDI CC selector

unfa Q: can we use this to with that pitch bend?
fundamental A: I don't think it's wired up that way at the moment as pitch bend
has a different parameter resolution comared to others. This can change in a
future version however

unfa Q: can we fake MIDI CC input for Macro learn?
fundamental A: If it does behave that way now, I'd think it would be wise to
make it not behave that way in the future.

==== Navigation Panel

The navigation panel is situated on the left side of the Zyn-Fusion UI and, much like the
status panel, is always present there.

It is used to change what the main panel is actively presenting.
The options, from top to bottom, include:

* PART SETTINGS
* Part grid
* BROWSER
* MIXER
* KITS
* Kit grid
* MACRO LEARN
* EFFECTS
* The ADDSynth panel
* The ADDSynth voice grid
* The SUBSynth panel
* The PADSynth panel

Each grid houses multiple elements with the same functionality,
and has one lit-up square, which is the currently displayed element.
Each active element has a border around it.
*To view an element in the grid, left-mouse click it.*
*To enable an element in the grid, middle-mouse click it.*

// TODO: Capitalize each word?
==== Main Panel (Introduction)

The main panel is where most of the action happens.

The scope of that is, understandably, very large, so it warrants
<<_main_panel, its own section in this part of the manual, visible below>>>>.

==== Virtual keyboard panel

The virtual keyboard is located at the bottom of the Zyn-Fusion interface.

=== Main Panel

The main panel covers all the core functionality in Zyn-Fusion,
in regard to sound design, effects, mixing, and so on.

We'll go over each subpanel from top to bottom as seen in the <<_navigation_panel, navigation panel>>.

==== Part settings

// TODO: Image with colors, or multiple images

This subpanel is dedicated to setting up each the properties of each part.

.What is a part?
NOTE: A part is a single element in ZynAddSubFX capable of generating sound.
In one part, any of ZynAddSubFX's three synths can be active.
So, think of parts like mini synths inside ZynAddSubFX
which you can use to have multiple layers to sounds,
have multiple sounds, maybe with different timbres, on one keyboard, etc.

===== Part enabling and naming

This subpanel consists of pairs of a button and a text input box.
The button enables the appropriate part, and the input box allows naming the part.

===== Instrument settings

VOLUME:: Volume, expressed in dB.
PAN:: Panning.
MIN KEY:: The minimum key from which the part starts playing
MAX KEY:: The maximum key to which the part plays

// TODO
VEL SENSE::
    Velocity sensing.

VEL OFFSET::
    Velocity offset.

KEY SHIFT::
    Shifts the key being played, same as KEY SHIFT in the <<_status_panel, Status panel>>.

Mn/R/Mx buttons::
    These buttons are used to set the minimum and maximum key that can be played.
    `Mn` sets the minimum key to the key last given to Zyn-Fusion as input,
    `Mx` does the same, except for the maximum key
    and `R` resets the limits back to cover the full keyboard.

Active MIDI channel::
    Shows which MIDI channel the part will except input from.
    By default, this is set to the ID of the part, i.e. CH1 for part 1, CH2 for part 2, etc.
    One part can only except input from one MIDI channel.
    In the case of music made using a DAW, you'll usually do everything on channel 1.
    In the case of live music, you may use more channels, across different parts of the keyboard.

Polyphony type::
    *POLY* means that each input will be added to the output as a separate voice.
    Use this if at any point you have two notes playing at the same time.
    *MONO* means only one key will be accepted and played back. If a new note is
    being played while another one is already on, the new one will playback.
    Once you stop playing the new note, the old one will start playing again.
    *LEGATO* is exactly what legato means in music typically.
    Only one note is played back at one time, much like in MONO.
    If you play one note and start playing another one,
    it will change the frequency of the old note to the frequency of the new note gradually,
    but quickly. Letting go shifts the frequency back down to the original note.
    Consider LEGATO to be MONO, but without playing the note from the start every time.
    *LATCH* means that any keys currently playing will keep playing, even when not held down,
    until a new key, or new keys, are played.

Voice limit::
    Sets how many voices the part can produce.
    This setting is very useful for patches which might take up a lot of CPU, because it allows you to limit how many voices it will make.
    The default is 0 and, ironically, means you can make an arbitrarily large, pracitcally infinite, number of voices.
    If you have sounds with a lot of release, you might need more voices, so that new ones don't cut the old ones while they're playing back.

=== General conventions

The Zyn-Fusion GUI tries to maintain a consistent language through it's controls.
The ones you'll see most commonly are:

* Buttons
* Sliders
* Knobs
* Number fields
* Input boxes

The knobs and sliders can be reset to their default position with a double-click or a middle-mouse click.

// TODO: No way to reset the number?
Number fields house `+` and `-` buttons which allow incrementing and decrementing the numeric value which the field stores.

Input boxes can be edited by either left- or right-mouse clicking on the box, and editing is stopped by clicking outside the box.

=== Using the Keyboard

Zyn-Fusion lets you use the keyboard in two ways:

* playing notes with the alpha-numeric keyboard
* accessing special functions with modifier keys

For example you can play a C-4 note by pressing the Q key, or play the C-3 note with the Z key. You can also change the keyboard layout between QWERTY and AZERTY in the Global Settings.

// Here should be a reference to an appropriate Global Settings subchapter

TIP: you can learn more about this in the <<Global Settings>> chapter.

// above is a non-working reference to another chapter. How do we make this work? Related issue: https://github.com/zynaddsubfx/user-manual/issues/3

Holding down Ctrl will temporarily activate Learn mode - any control touched will be assigned to a macro.

// Here should be a reference to chapter about Macro Learn

Holding down Shift will temporarily activate Fine mode - this will greatly increase the input resolution allowing for more precise manipulation.
